 C# Best Coding Practices
 
 1. Avoid using a lof of comments, if any, its purpose should be clear
 Never try to explain what your code does line by line
 
 2. Use the proper naming convention. for example: 
  Method parameter - camelCase
  Variable - camelCase
  Namespace -	PascalCase
  Class -	PascalCase
  Method name -	PascalCase
  Property -	PascalCase
  Field  - 	_camelCase
  
  3. Keep your methods short.
  
  4. Do not give your methods too many parameters, having just two parameters is OK
  
  5. Avoid complicated conditional logic in your code. 
  
  6. Try not to repeat code - DRY (Dont Repeat Yourself)
  
  7. Use the KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid). Avoid writing complex code you'd end up forgetting how you came by.
  
  8. Remember someone else might hhave to maintain your code, so write "human understandableÂ£" code
  
  9. Follow the Boys' Scout Rule - leaving the code better than you found it.
  
  10. Use the best IDE available
  
  11. Perform code reviews, this helps you get more familiar with codes and coding concepts, even spotting errors.
  
  12. Eliminate dead or unused code
  
  13. Minimize the use of global variables that are accessible from anywherw within the code
  
  14. Write private code, using private fields and methods as much as possible in your code
  
  15. Use constants instead of magic numbers/magic strings
  
  for example: 
  instead of 
  if (items.Count > 5)
  we use a variable instead
  if (itemsInCart < MAXIMUM_SIZE_FOR_DISCOUNT)
